Some good configs I made for this update!

**Blatant:**
Does not have KeepY, but uses Sprint Scaffold with Speed and has an above 100% AirMotion Tower

**Blatant2:**
Same thing as **Blatant**, but instead of fireball_high uses fireball_flat.

**Reverse:**
Basically same thing as **Blatant** again, but instead of 0,100 uses 95,100 reverse + Cotton Candy theme from Raven

**Reverse2:**
Same thing as **Reverse** but uses fireball flat!
